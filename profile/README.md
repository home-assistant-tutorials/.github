## Welcome

This organization has the purpose to bundle some tutorials about Home Assistant.
For the beginning the scope is the development of custom code like cards or
integrations.

## Howto

Each tutorial is done as a separate github repository to be able to ship code
alongside. To learn how to set up the development environment at all see
*tutorial 1*.

Depending on the type of the tutorial the repository is cloned into different
"workspaces". Tutorials of cards are cloned into a frontend workspace with the
path `config/www/tutor`. A `hello-moon` repository would get the path
`config/www/tutor/hello-moon`.
